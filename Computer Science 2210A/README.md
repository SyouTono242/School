# CS2210A - Data Structures and Algorithms

## Course Description
The purpose of this course is to provide the students with solid foundations in the basic concepts of programming: data structures and algorithms. The main objective of the course is to teach the students how to select and design data structures and algorithms that are appropriate for problems that they might encounter. This course is also about showing the correctness of algorithms and studying their computational complexities. This course offers the students a mixture of theoretical knowledge and practical experience.

The study of data structures and algorithms is carried out within an object-oriented framework. When implementations are considered, the Java programming language is used.

Topics covered in this course include:
- analysis of algorithms
- dictionaries, hash tables
- trees, binary search trees, multi-way search trees, (2,4)-trees, B-trees
- graphs, graph traversals, graph algorithms
- sorting

## Assignments
- Assignment 1 - Theory based questions (written, no code)
- Assignment 2 - Implements Hash Tables and Compression to create a dictionary
- Assignment 3 - Theory based questions (written, no code)
- Assignment 4 - Implements Binary Trees to create a simple game of Pac-Man
- Assignment 5 - Implements Graphs, and Graph Traversals to solve a bus route problem
