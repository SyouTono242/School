VERY IMPORTANT READ ME
TO RUN THE JAVA PROGRAM FOR QUESTION 11 ENTER THE FOLLOWING COMMAND

./asn3.sh < file

WHERE FILE IS THE NAME OF THE FILE USED AS INPUT.

IT MUST BE DONE IN THIS WAY OTHERWISE THE PROGRAM WILL NOT RUN.

THIS IS HOW IT WAS SPECIFIED IN THE ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION.

ALSO NOTE, WHEN I WAS TESTING ON GAUL THE OUTPUT TOOK ABOUT 15-20 SECONDS TO SHOW UP.
SO, DO NOT RUSH IF IT DOES NOT APPEAR.

TO RUN THE PROGRAM AS ./asn3.sh file, YOU CANNOT RUN THE SCRIPT.YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO THE FOLLOWING.-	javac prims.java-	java prims file

IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
