# Assignment 1

## Description
Consider the Fibonacci numbers: F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2), n>1; F(0)=0; F(1)=1.

## Part 1
Write a recursive function to compute F(n) using the above definition directly. Imple- ment your solution and print F (i ∗ 5), where 0 ≤ i ≤ 7, as output.

## Part 2
Write a recursive function/procedure to compute F (n) with time complexity O(n) (more precisely, the time complexity should be O(nA(n)) when n is large, where A(n) is the com- plexity of adding F (n − 1) and F (n − 2)). Implement your solution and print F (i ∗ 10), where 0 ≤ i ≤ 30, as output. This program must be able to compute F(n) precisely for n ≤ 300.
