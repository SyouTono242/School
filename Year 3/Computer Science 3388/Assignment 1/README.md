# Assignment 1

## Description
This assignment is about creating a simple animation with the rectangles using basic transformations.


## Implementation
1. First of all, create an window of size 640 × 640 in black background.
2. The window will contain at least 15 inanimate rectangles, each of which have their own randomized colours, start positions, initial orientations and dimensions.
3. When the user presses ‘s’ on the keyboard, the animation begins.
4. When the animation begins, the rectangles rotate about their own centres along the z- axis, either clockwise or counter-clockwise (which is also selected randomly).
5. The rectangles also move in randomized directions based of a random 2D vector and the rectangles wrap around the screen in such a manner that when the rectangle disappears beyond the bounds of the screen, it will appear on the opposite side again.
6. Also, the rectangles periodically and rhythmically change shape.
7. However, the colours of each rectangle do not change.
8. When the user presses ‘q’ on their keyboard, the program will exit.
